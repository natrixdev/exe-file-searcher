# exe-file-searcher
a Python script that searches for all files with the .exe extension in the current working directory and its subdirectories


This script uses the `os` and `tkinter` libraries to implement the file search functionality and the graphical interface. When run, it opens a file explorer window for the user to select the folder to search, and then lists the results in a listbox.
